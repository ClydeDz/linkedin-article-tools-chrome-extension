# LinkedIn Article Tools

Adds four always-visible buttons to LinkedIn for instant access to New Article, Drafts, Scheduled, and Published pages.

## Why?

LinkedIn Article Tools adds a convenient sticky footer to your LinkedIn pages, giving you instant one-click access to all your article-related pages. No more hunting through menus to find where to write or manage your articles.

This extension adds four always-visible buttons to the bottom of LinkedIn:

- Write a New Article – Jump straight into creating your next post.
- Drafts – Quickly view and edit your in-progress articles.
- Scheduled – Check what’s lined up to be published.
- Published – See your live articles in one click.

LinkedIn doesn’t make it easy to reach these pages, but with LinkedIn Article Tools, you’ll save time and keep your writing flow uninterrupted. Whether you’re a content creator, thought leader, or casual writer, these buttons make article management fast, simple, and effortless.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!
