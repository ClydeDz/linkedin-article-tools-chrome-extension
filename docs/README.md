# Goodreads to Auckland Library Navigator Chrome Extension

Adds a 1-click 'Search in Auckland Library' button on the Goodreads book page to easily find your Goodreads book in the Auckland Library website.

## Why?

When I've come across a good book recommendation on Goodreads, I always end up manually having to search it on the Auckland Library website. That's a lot of clicks and a lot of typing.

But what if I had a button on the Goodreads page that redirected me to the Auckland Library search page with everything filled up and the search results already waiting for me? Wouldn't that save me a lot of time and effort? I think I'd also be able to save and hold books in the library much faster.

Well, you don't have to imagine the possibility anymore. Because now, with this extension, we can do just that. This extension adds a 1-click 'Search in Auckland Library' button on the Goodreads book page to easily find your Goodreads book in the Auckland Library website.

Happy reading!
